# python-play

python-play is a personal learning project where I explore the basics of Python programming.  
This repository includes small scripts, experiments, and exercises that help me practice core Python concepts such as variables, loops, functions, file handling, and more.  

The goal of python-play is to build a strong foundation in Python through hands-on coding and experimentation.
